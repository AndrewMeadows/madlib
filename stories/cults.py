How to Tell if a(n) {church=noun} is a(n) {cult=noun}

{Religious=adjective} {cults={cult=noun}+pl} are groups of {people=plural_person} who adhere to a(n) {strict=adjective} belief system and organize around a(n) {charismatic=adjective} {leader=person}. Unlike a(n) {church=noun}, a(n) {religious=adjective} {cult=noun} is {destructive=adjective} and uses {fear=abstract_noun} and {manipulation=abstract_noun} to command their {membership=plural_person}. If you evaluate their {doctrine=abstract_noun}, examine their {practices=plural_noun}, and take your time to look at the {church=noun} {objectively=adverb}, you can determine whether an organization is a legitimate {church=noun} or a(n) {cult=noun}.

1. Read the {church=noun}'s {rules=plural_noun}.
{Cults={cult=noun}+pl} thrive on the {unquestioning=adjective} {obedience=abstract_noun} of their {membership=plural_person}. Often, a(n) {cult=noun}'s {rules=plural_noun} will be {arbitrary=adjective} and many of them will {benefit=verb_i} the {leader=person} of the {cult=noun}. Also, there are often {harsh=adjective} punishments for {breaking={break=verb_t}+ing} the {rules=plural_noun}, such as mandatory {physical labor=activity}.

2. Determine what would happen if you {left={leave=verb_i}+past} the {church=noun}.
{cults={cult=noun}+pl} will often have {severe=adjective} punishments in place for those who decide to {leave=verb_i} the {church=noun}. Common consequences could include a punishment directly from {God=name} or being prevented from talking to {family=plural_person} and {friends=plural_person} within the {church=noun}.

3. Beware of {denunciation=adjective} {sessions=plural_noun}.
{Denunciation=adjective} {sessions=plural_noun} are displays of {public=adjective} {humiliation=abstract_noun}, where the {leader=person} of the {church=noun} will {humiliate=verb_t} you in front of other members. If the {church=noun} mandates group activities like this, it's a sign it could be a(n) {cult=noun}.

4. Avoid a(n) {church=noun} that obsesses over {prophecy=noun} or that talk of {mass=adjective} {suicide=abstract_noun}.
Many {cults={cult=noun}+pl} will obsess over a(n) {fabricated=adjective} {prophecy=noun} or talk about {mass=adjective} {suicide=abstract_noun}. If the {church=noun} preaches about scary {unavoidable=adjective} {prophecies=plural_noun} or {suicide=abstract_noun}, it is probably a(n) {cult=noun}.

5. Determine if they have an elitist {thing=noun}.
Many {cults={cult=noun}+pl} will have an elitist {thing=noun} that sees itself as superior to those outside of the {cult=noun}. {cults={cult=noun}+pl} will often convince members that they are an elite group of {people=plural_person} who were born to {save=verb_t} the world or {change=verb_t} the course of {human=noun} history. If you notice an elitist or {arrogant=adjective} {personality=abstract_noun} from the members, it could be a(n) {cult=noun}.
