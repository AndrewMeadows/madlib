How to Talk to {God=name}

Talking to {God=name} involves a very {spiritual=adjective}, {personal=adjective}, often {private=adjective}, relationship. With so many opinions about relating to {God=name}, figuring out how you should talk to {God=name} may seem complicated. But it doesn’t have to be. How you choose to connect and talk to {God=adjective} will simply boil down to what seems right to you. No matter your {spiritual=adjective} preference or {religion=abstract_noun}, learning how to communicate effectively with {God=name} can be achieved with the following tips.

1. Determine how you see {God=name}.
You’ll need to determine who {God=name} is to you in order to confidently talk to {God=name}. Who is, and how do you define, {God=name}? Do you know {God=name} as a fatherly or motherly figure, a(n) {teacher=person}, a distant -- or a close {friend=person}, sticking closer than a(n) {sister=person} or {brother=person}? Or, is {God=name} an abstract {spiritual=adjective} guide? Is your connection to {God=name} rooted in a(n) {personal=adjective}, {spiritual=adjective} relationship you have with {God=name}? Or, do you follow the form and order of your {religion=abstract_noun} to understand who {God=name} is to you? Whichever is true for you will dictate how you view and talk to {God=name}. And, however you see {God=name} determines how you will approach {God=name} to talk to {God=name} as you see them.

2. Talk to {God=name} as you would a(n) {close=adjective}, {loving=adjective} but {allpowerful=adjective} {friend=person}.
Talking to {God=name} as a tremendous {friend=person} is different from just praying to {God=name} as a need or duty. As with a(n) {friend=person}, you expect back-and-forth communication by noticing how {God=name} answers, helps or teaches you. While prayer may be more of a one-way transaction, talking implies a conversation.

3. Have a talk with {God=name}.
Talk to {God=name} similarly as you would, if a(n) {physical=adjective} {person=person} were standing in front of you. You can talk to {God=name} about your daily troubles, your thoughts at the moment, your hopes and dreams, and even tell them (and tell yourself) the things for which you’re {thankful=adjective}. You can tell {God=name} about {casual=adjective} or {hard=adjective} topics just as you would with a(n) {concerned=adjective} {friend=person}.

4. Watch for and pay attention to possible feedback.
You may not get an audible response like you would, if a(n) {friend=person} were physically standing in front of you. But you can receive a response from {God=name} in the written word or from the {sermon=abstract_noun} of a(n) {minister=person}. Anticipate it to also come in the form of a(n) {intuition=abstract_noun}, a(n) {inspiration=abstract_noun}, a(n) {scripture=noun}, a(n) {situation=noun} or an event that directly or indirectly relates to what you’ve been talking about to {God=name}.

~FIN~
