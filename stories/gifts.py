How to give a great {gift} to someone

It can be nerve-racking finding a great {gift} for someone. Finding a {gift} that the recipient will {enjoy} takes a bit of {direction}ward {thinking} and an understanding of the recipient's {personality} and {tastes}.

1. Consider how {close} you are to that person.
If you have a {close} relationship with the person, be it {intimate} or {platonic}, you may select a {gift} that is more {personal}. If you are not {close} to the person, you may choose a {gift} that is more useful or {accessible}.

2. Identify items the person may {need}.
Think about any items the person may {need} in their day-to-day life or a big {purchase} that the person needs to do but has been putting off. This could be a new {kitchen} appliance the person has been eyeing or a new {backpack} the person needs for a new year of {school}.

3. Arrange a {experience} as a {gift}.
Often, giving someone a {experience} can be more {impactful} than giving them a {item}. This could be a {couples} massage, a sky diving {date}, or dinner at the personâ€™s favorite {restaurant}. Think of {experience}s that will {surprise} and {excite} the person, as these will often make a lasting impression.

4. Donate your {time} as part of the {gift}. 
If the person is often stressed, overworked, or going through a hard time, offer to gift them your {time}. This could be by {doing} all the {yardwork} for {week} or by {taking} their {kids} out for {day} so they have some free time to themself.
