How to give a great {gift=noun} to someone

It can be nerve-racking finding a great {gift=noun} for someone. Finding a(n) {gift=noun} that the recipient will {enjoy=verb_i} takes a bit of {direction=direction}ward {thinking=verb_i_ing} and an understanding of the recipient's {personality=abstract_noun} and {tastes=abstract_noun}.

1. Consider how {close=adjective} you are to that person.
If you have a(n) {close=adjective} relationship with the person, be it {intimate=adjective} or {platonic=adjective}, you may select a(n) {gift=adjective} that is more {personal=adjective}. If you are not {close=adjective} to the person, you may choose a(n) {gift=noun} that is more useful or {accessible=adjective}.

2. Identify items the person may {need=verb_t}.
Think about any items the person may {need=verb_t} in their day-to-day life or a big {purchase=noun_from_verb} that the person needs to do but has been putting off. This could be a new {kitchen=noun} appliance the person has been eyeing or a new {backpack=noun} the person needs for a new year of {school=activity}.

3. Arrange a(n) {experience=abstract_noun} as a(n) {gift=noun}.
Often, giving someone a(n) {experience=abstract_noun} can be more {impactful=adjective} than giving them a(n) {item=noun}. This could be a(n) {couples=noun} massage, a sky-diving {date=noun}, or dinner at the personâ€™s favorite {restaurant=business}. Think of {experience=abstract_noun}s that will {surprise=verb_t} and {excite=verb_t} the person, as these will often make a lasting impression.

4. Donate your {time=abstract_noun} as part of the {gift=noun}. 
If the person is often stressed, overworked, or going through a hard time, offer to gift them your {time=abstract_noun}. This could be by {doing=verb_t_ing} all the {yardwork=plural_noun} for {week=duration} or by {taking=verb_t_ing} their {kids=plural_noun} out for {day=duration} so they have some free time to themself.
