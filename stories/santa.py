How to write a letter to {Santa=name}

Writing a letter to {Santa=name} is a fun {Christmas=holiday} tradition. A well written letter shows {Santa=name} you are {polite=adjective}. Plus, it makes it easier for them to get you the {presents=plural_noun} you want. After all, with millions of {children=plural_person} (and {children=plural_person}-at-heart) asking for {presents=plural_noun}, you could say they are a pretty {busy=adjective} {guy=person}. Start by thinking about what you want to ask for in advance. Then, write a(n) {polite=adjective} letter, {decorate=verb_t} it, and give it to your {parents=plural_person} to send off to {NorthPole=place}.

1. Pick what you'll write on. You can keep it simple with a(n) {plain=adjective} {white=color} piece of {paper=material} or you can go for something a little bolder. {Colorful=adjective} {construction=noun_from_verb} {paper=material} works well. Whatever {paper=material} you pick, make sure to grab a couple of pieces in case of mess-ups.

2. Choose something to write with. You can use a pen or a pencil, but feel free to use {crayons=plural_noun}, {colored_pencils=plural_noun}, and {markers=plural_noun}, too. You can even combine different writing tools, like {markers=plural_noun} and {colored_pencils=plural_noun}, to make a super {colorful=adjective} letter.

3. Begin your letter with "{Dear=exclam} {Santa=name}."

4. Tell {Santa=name} who you are. {Santa=name} knows you, of course â€“ they have been watching you all year. However, they get lots of letters, so they need to know which one is yours.

5. Ask {Santa=name} how they are doing. It is always {polite=adjective} to ask the person you are writing to how they are and {Santa=name} is no exception. You could ask them how the weather has been in {NorthPole=place}, how {MrsClaus=name} is doing, or if the {reindeer=plural_noun} enjoyed the {food=plural_or_mass} you left out for them last year.

6. Tell {Santa=name} the {good} things you have done this year. They are a(n) {busy=adjective} {guy=person}, so they may need a little reminder about how {good=adjective} you have been. Tell them about your {accomplishments=abstract_noun} at {school=activity}, the {good=adjective} things you have done for your {family=plural_person} and {friends=plural_person}, and how {well=adverb} you have listened to your {parents=plural_person}. Remember to be {honest=adjective}. {Santa}'s had their eye on you, so they will know if you are being {truthful=related_adjective}.

7. Ask {Santa=name} {politely=adverb} for the things on your list. Take a look at the list you wrote {days=duration} ago, which should have a few {presents=plural_noun} that you really love. Then {politely=adverb} ask {Santa=name} for these things in your letter; remember to say {please=phrase}.

8. Finish up by thanking {Santa=name}. It is a lot of work delivering millions of {presents=plural_noun} to {children=plural_person} all over {the_world=place} in {a_single_night=duration}, so thank {Santa=name} for their {kindness=abstract_noun}.
