How to write a letter to {Santa}

Writing a letter to {Santa} is a fun {Christmas} tradition. A well written letter shows {Santa} you are {polite}. Plus, it makes it easier for them to get you the {presents} you want. After all, with millions of {children} (and {children}-at-heart) asking for {presents}, you could say they are a pretty {busy} {guy}. Start by thinking about what you want to ask for in advance. Then, write a {polite} letter, {decorate} it, and give it to your {parents} to send off to {NorthPole}.

1. Pick what you'll write on. You can keep it simple with a {plain} {white} piece of {paper} or you can go for something a little bolder. {Colorful} {construction} {paper} works well. Whatever {paper} you pick, make sure to grab a couple of pieces in case of mess-ups.

2. Choose something to write with. You can use a pen or a pencil, but feel free to use {crayons}, {colored_pencils}, and {markers}, too. You can even combine different writing tools, like {markers} and {colored_pencils}, to make a super {colorful} letter.

3. Begin your letter with "{Dear} {Santa}."

4. Tell {Santa} who you are. {Santa} knows you, of course â€“ they have been watching you all year. However, they get lots of letters, so they need to know which one is yours.

5. Ask {Santa} how they are doing. It is always {polite} to ask the person you are writing to how they are and {Santa} is no exception. You could ask them how the weather has been in {NorthPole}, how {MrsClaus} is doing, or if the {reindeer} enjoyed the {food} you left out for them last year.

6. Tell {Santa} the {good} things you have done this year. They are a {busy} {guy}, so they may need a little reminder about how {good} you have been. Tell them about your {accomplishments} at {school}, the {good} things you have done for your family and friends, and how {well} you have listened to your {parents}. Remember to be {honest}. {Santa}'s had their eye on you, so they will know if you are being {truthful}.

7. Ask {Santa} {politely} for the things on your list. Take a look at the list you wrote {days} ago, which should have a few {presents} that you really love. Then {politely} ask {Santa} for these things in your letter; remember to say {please}.

8. Finish up by thanking {Santa}. It is a lot of work delivering millions of {presents} to {children} all over {the_world} in a {single} night, so thank {Santa} for their {kindness}.
