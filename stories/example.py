The History of {Mad=adjective} Libs

{Mad=adjective} Libs is a(n) {phrasal=noun} template {word=noun} game. It consists of one {player=person} prompting others for a list of {words=plural_noun} to substitute for {blanks=plural_noun} in a story before reading aloud. The game is frequently played as a(n) {party=noun} game or as a pastime.

Mad Libs was invented in {_1953=year} by {Stern=name} and {Price=name}. {Stern=name} and {Price=name} created the game, but could not agree on a name for their invention. No name was chosen until {five=number} years later ({_1958=year}), when {Stern=year} and {Price=year} were eating {Eggs_Benedict=food} at a(n) {restaurant=business} in {NYC=place}. While eating, the two overheard an argument at a neighboring table between a(n) {agent=person} and a(n) {actor=person}. According to {Price=name} and {Stern=name}, during the overheard argument, the {actor=noun} said that they wanted to "ad-lib" an upcoming {interview=event}. The {agen=noun}, who clearly disagreed with the {actor=noun}'s suggestion, retorted that ad-libbing a(n) {interview=event} would be "{mad=adjective}". {Stern=name} and {Price=name} used that eavesdropped conversation to create, at length, the name "{Mad=adjective} Libs". In {_1958=year}, the duo released the first book of {Mad=adjective} Libs, which resembled the earlier games of Consequences and {Exquisite=adjective} Corpse.
