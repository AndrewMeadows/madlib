How to Know when {Oat=noun} Milk Is {Bad=adj}

{Oat=noun} milk is a(n) {popular=adj} alternative to dairy milk because it's {better={good=adj}+compar} for the environment and {healthier={healthy=adj}+compar} in many ways. {Oat=noun} milk has a shorter window of time that it's {fresh=adj} — it usually lasts about {7-10 days=duration} in the fridge once it's been opened. After that point, inspect, smell, or taste the milk to see if it's {spoiled=adj}. If not, drink up, but if so, toss it out!

1. Check the {expiration=abstract_noun} date on the {oat=noun} milk container.
{Expiration=abstract_noun} dates are the first thing you should check when deciding whether your {oat=noun} milk is still {good=adj} or not. If the date hasn’t passed yet, it’s likely that your {oat=noun} milk is still {safe=adj} to drink. If the date has passed, check other characteristics of the milk to ensure it’s still {good=adj}.

2. Pour a little bit of the milk in the sink to check the {consistency=abstract_noun}.
When {oat=noun} milk is {spoiled=adj} it becomes {chunky=adj} and has a(n) {thicker={thick=adj}+compar} {consistency=abstract_noun}. To test this, pour a little bit of {oat=noun} milk into the sink or in a(n) {bowl=noun}. If you notice that it’s {lumpy=adj} and has an {uneven=adj} {texture=abstract_noun} instead of being {smooth=adj}, it’s likely {bad=adj}.

3. Look at the color of the milk to see if it has turned {yellow=color}.
{Spoiled=adj} {oat=noun} milk has a(n) {yellow=color} tint, darker than its natural, {fresh=adj} color. If you notice that your milk doesn’t look the same color as it did when you bought or made it, it might be {spoiled=adj}.

4. Smell the {oat=noun} milk to check for a(n) {sour=adj} scent.
Open the container of {oat=noun} milk and smell it — if it smells slightly {acidic=adj} or not {fresh=adj}, it might have gone {bad=adj}. When {oat=noun} milk is way past its {expiration=abstract_noun} date, it gives off a strong {sour=adj} smell that's easily distinguishable from its normal smell.

5. Drink a little bit of {oat=noun} milk to see if it tastes {tart=adj}.
If you’re still not sure whether the milk is {spoiled=adj} or not, pour a small amount onto a(n) {spoon=noun}. Taste the {oat=noun} milk and see if it tastes {sour=adj} or not. If it does taste {sour=adj}, spit it out and dispose of the milk.
